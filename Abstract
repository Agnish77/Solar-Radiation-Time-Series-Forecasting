The research paper yet to be published focuses on the importance of accurately forecasting solar radiance for efficient power grid operation and energy management. It evaluates the performance of various sequential models, including LSTM, Bi-LSTM, Hybrid LSTM, Simple RNN, and Stacked LSTM, for predicting solar radiation over different forecast horizons ranging from 5 to 45 hours. The study finds that while Stacked LSTM, Hybrid LSTM, and Bi-LSTM models generally perform better across most horizons and metrics, the proposed hybrid model shows superior performance in most cases
